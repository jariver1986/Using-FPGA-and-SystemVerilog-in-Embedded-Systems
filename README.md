An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is an integrated circuit that can be configured by the customer or designer after manufacturingâ€”hence the term "field-programmable." Unlike traditional fixed-function hardware, FPGAs allow for the design of custom digital circuits, offering flexibility and adaptability for a wide range of applications.
